suffix tree
Graphs with different representations: Adjacency list, set of vertices and edges, disjoint set.
Union-find / disjoint set data structure for graph representation
Basic graph algorithms:
  -- Get connected components / strongly connected components
  -- Find if there is a path between two nodes
Check BST property
Find all paths in a tree that sum up to a value
Check if a tree is a subtree of another tree
Lowest common ancestor in a tree, if the tree is: a) a binary tree, b) a binary search tree.
