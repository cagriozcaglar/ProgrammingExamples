Leetcode 224: Basic Calculator

Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string may contain open ( and closing parentheses ), the plus + or minus sign -, non-negative integers and empty spaces .

Example 1:
Input: "1 + 1"
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3

Example 3:
Input: "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23

Solution: Stack and no string reversal
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the string. The difference in time complexity between this approach and the previous one is that every character in this approach will get processed exactly once. However, in the previous approach, each character can potentially get processed twice, once when it's pushed onto the stack and once when it's popped for processing of the final result (or a subexpression). That's why this approach is faster.
- Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the string.
