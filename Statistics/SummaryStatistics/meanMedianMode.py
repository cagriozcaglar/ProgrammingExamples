"""
Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating the mean, median, and mode. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task 
Given an array, , of  integers, calculate and print the respective mean, median, and mode on separate lines. If your array contains more than one modal value, choose the numerically smallest one.

Note: Other than the modal value (which will always be an integer), your answers should be in decimal form, rounded to a scale of  decimal place (i.e., ,  format).

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the array's elements.

Constraints

, where  is the  element of the array.
Output Format

Print  lines of output in the following order:

Print the mean on a new line, to a scale of  decimal place (i.e., , ).
Print the median on a new line, to a scale of  decimal place (i.e., , ).
Print the mode on a new line; if more than one such value exists, print the numerically smallest one.

Sample Input:
10
64630 11735 14216 99233 14470 4978 73429 38120 51135 67060

Sample Output:
43900.6
44627.5
4978
